"Details" opens the software details window and "Logout" logs the user out and returns to the "Login" form.
By clicking on the "Municipalities" and "Types of Contracts" buttons, municipalities and contract types can be viewed. Add, edit and delete functionalities are available only to administrators:

By clicking the "Add" button, users can add new municipalities, click "Edit" to change the selected municipality, and click "Delete" to delete it. Editing can also be done by double-clicking on the desired row. Each delete button in the application displays a confirmation window. Similar windows open for contract types.
From the main menu, users can change their username and password, while only administrators can change privileges:

From the main menu, the administrator can see all users and their privileges, but not their passwords:

Administrators can also create, modify and delete users here:

Clicking on the edit button also leaves an empty field in place of the password, this is intended in case the user forgets his password or cannot log in, then the administrator can enter a new one.
The user can do all the basic functions, but cannot add, change or delete tables of municipalities, types of contracts and users, unlike the administrator who can do everything. The tourist can only look at the tables and search the contracts.
From the main menu, by clicking on the "Contracts" button, a form with the display of all contracts opens:

Contracts are colored according to the "adopted" field. The data in the tables on each form can be sorted by clicking on the name of the desired column. Users can search for contracts by all fields, and export the resulting or initial table in the desired Excel format:

On any form with a table, users can right-click to copy the contents of a field or the contents of an entire row, separated by commas, to the Clipboard. Numeric and date data can be searched with comparison characters. By clicking on the squares in front of the date fields, they are included/excluded from the search. The search is performed on the "Search" button or by clicking on the "Enter" key. The "Refresh" button reloads the entire table. "History of Changes" shows the history of changes of each field for the selected contract that is selected by clicking on a row in the table:

"Change History of Deleted Contracts" works the same, only for deleted contracts that are not visible in the table.
"Add" opens a new form where users can add a new contract with different parameters:

![](Manual-SRB-11.png)

Fields "Municipality", "Contract Type", "Contract term (interval), where appropriate values can be selected. The "End date" field is automatically changed in relation to the date of the contract, depending on the term of the contract. Clicking on the "Adopted" check box reveals or hides the "Date of adoption" and "Official owner number" fields. If this check box is unchecked, the contract being added or modified will have the value of the adoption date 01/01/1970 which indicates a non-existent date. For all forms of changes or additions, "Save" makes the given changes and "Cancel" discards them and does not change the tables.
From the "Contracts" form, "Edit", opens the same form as for adding, only for the selected contract from the form. Here users can change contract information. Opening the modification form can also be done by double-clicking on the desired contract. If the user opens the add or edit form and in the meantime another user makes a change to the same contract, an error window appears. This enables the correct operation of the database.
The "Delete" button, on the "Contracts" form, deletes the selected contract and only administrators can do this:

"Contract files" opens a form where all related files and their paths for the selected contract are displayed:

By clicking on "Show" or double-clicking on the desired contract, the selected contract is opened in the appropriate program according to the file type. Clicking on "Add" opens a window where you can select one desired file to add:
On the "Contract files" form, "Remove" deletes the file from the table but not the file on disk. Also only administrators can do this.
